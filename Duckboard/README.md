## How to use Duckboard

Duckboard is an app for duck lovers everywhere. It is an app that allows you to look at photos of ducks and save them to your very own Duckboard. 

Duckboard uses the Random-d.uk API: https://random-d.uk/api

It pulls duck photos and displays them in the app.

Push the "Show me a duck!" button to load a photo of a duck. Once the photo is loaded, you can load a new duck, add the photo to your Duckboard by pushing the heart or toggle to your Duckboard to look at your photos.

Push the "Show me my Duckboard" button to show all the duck photos you favorited.

On the Duckboard, you can click the "Edit" button to delete the photos. Click Done to exit the Editing view.

If you don't click "Edit" and just tap on one of the photos, the photo expands and the user can view the photo bigger. 

The API specification comes from the Duck API pulling photos.
The Core Data specification comes from the Favorited photos being persisted. 

To run the app, download the files and push "run" in your simulator.
